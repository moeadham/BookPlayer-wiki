It's not always easy to name things in a larger project, so this page tries to lay out some base rules.

- The app is called *BookPlayer*.
- The collection of books and playlists is called *Library*.
- A playlist contains *items* not books.
- A book is always a *book*, we don't need to say audiobook.
- You can only import *files* not books, they become *items* (in a playlist) or *books* (in the *Library*) only after import.
- All alerts should provide named actions, never yes or no.
