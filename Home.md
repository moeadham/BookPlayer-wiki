## Where can I get audiobooks that work with BookPlayer?

[LibriVox](https://librivox.org/) provides many wonderful audiobooks to start. They even have a M4B download option which is the format that works best with BookPlayer. 

You can also easily combine the MP3 files from audiobooks you bought on CD using the tools found below.

## How to combine MP3 files into M4B audio books

While BookPlayer supports playing MP3 just fine, it really shines when used with M4B based audio books.

To create these, there are several tools at your disposal: 

- [Audiobook Binder](http://bluezbox.com/audiobookbinder.html) (Mac, Free) 
- [Audiobook Creator](http://www.audiobookcreator.de/en/index.html) (Windows, Free) 
- [Chapter and Verse](http://lodensoftware.com/chapter-and-verse/) (Windows, Free) 

We do not have any affiliation with any of these tools. If you find something that works better for you, please tell us so we can extend our list.

Combining your files not only makes it easier to handle them, but also makes it easier for BookPlayer to display the right artwork and chapters.
